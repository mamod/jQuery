=head1 NAME

jQuery - complete jQuery port to Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    ##OOP style
    
    use jQuery;
    my $j = jQuery->new('http://someurl.com');
    
    ##or insert html directly
    my $j = jQuery->new('<html>...</html>');
    
    $j->jQuery('p')->append( sub {
      my $i = shift;
      my $html = shift;
      return "<strong>Hello</strong>";
    } )->css('color','red');
    
    print $j->as_HTML;
    
    ##non OOP - more like jQuery.js style
    jQuery->new($html);

    jQuery("p")->append( sub{
        my $i = shift;
        my $html = shift;
        return "<strong>Hello</strong>";
    } )->css('color','red');
    
    print jQuery->as_HTML;
  
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

I love Perl and I also love jQuery so this is my attempt to completely port jQuery
to Perl, or at least things that work on the server side, like selecting, parsing, and manipulating
HTML DOM.

=head2 How this differ from other Perl jQuery modules?

Well, first I wrote this module long time ago, maybe long before any other jQuery
modules but didn't publish it until now since I wasn't sure "and still" about it's performance
or code quality, even though I used it in a couple of commercial projects I still need
more tests, I publish it now because I need a motive and help to continue this project

=head2 Main differences "as I think"

    * it uses XML::LibXML as it's parsing engine
    
    * Very much like jQuery.js, if you ever used jQuery.js you will be familiar with this module too
    
    * Almost all jQuery DOM functions are supported
